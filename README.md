## This is what I learnt

1. Firebase is an online database that will connect directly to our app. As we develop, publish our app, we can connect this online data store and be automatically notified of any changes to our data by other users of our application. Whenever data changes, we can decide to update components and present the new information to our users.
2. I use firebase to create a new project on firebase console, install firebase local library and initialize it using some configuration, which tells firebase to connect the specific project that I have created
3. I learnt how to handle text input inside a form, we use state to tell the input what is the value should be, so that we can manipulate userâ€™s input or tell user what their inputs are.
4. I learnt how to handle conditional rendering by creating a helper method to tell user what content I would like to show to the user.
5. I learnt how to create reusable components and how to import all the components in one line code, which is creating index.js in common folder.
6. For better UX, we need to show spinner whenever we are loading a page.
